Hi,

Please find my soccer league project for review. I am aiming for the 'Exceed 
Expectations' grade on this project.

I found the hardest part of this project was choosing the correct data type to store the data from the CSV file. I opted for a dictionary because I thought it would allow me to easily store the player alongside their associated data. Whilst this does work, I had to create lists to process the data. Also, it caused a further problem when getting the player's team name for the individual letters. I got around this using the 'any' keyword which I have referenced in the comments.

I liked the fact that I was able to use the pop() function to distribute experienced and amateur players across the team, but I would be interested to know if I have made this project more complex than it need to be?

Many thanks,
Chris
